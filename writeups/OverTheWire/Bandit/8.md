# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once
```
---
We are hinted to use the `uniq` command, which needs the file output to be sorted before used (read on `unie --help`):
```shell
bandit8@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort | tail -n 1
      1 FLAG{}
```


# Flag
