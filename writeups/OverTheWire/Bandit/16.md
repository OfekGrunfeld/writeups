# Description
```
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
```

Using the hinted `nmap` we can scan through the portrange and see which services they host:
```shell
$ nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000

Clearly its port 31790:
```
openssl s_client -p 31790
# paste password
KEYUPDATE
```
Seems like an internal problem. Searching up online we need to add the `-quiet` flag:
```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
# paste password
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
SSH key.
