# Description
```
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit31-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit31-git` is the same as for the user `bandit31`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
```

Another git level...
This time running `git log -p` gets us:
```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..0edecc0
--- /dev/null
+++ b/README.md
@@ -0,0 +1,7 @@
+This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.
+
+Details:
+    File name: key.txt
+    Content: 'May I come in?'
+    Branch: master
+
```

Which I presume I'd need to push a `key.txt` file, and a push hook will give me the password.
```
echo "May I Come in?" > key.txt && rm .gitignore && ga -A && gc -m "add key" && sshpass -p "FLAG{}" gp
