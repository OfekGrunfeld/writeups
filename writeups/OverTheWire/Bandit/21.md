# Description
```
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
```
---
`/etc/cron.d` hold a cronjob called `cronjob_bandit22`:
```shell
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
bandit21@bandit:~$ /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh 
chmod: changing permissions of '/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv': Operation not permitted
/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh: line 3: /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv: Permission denied
```
Seems like its running the temp file as the `bandit22` user.  Though actually `cat`-ing the file seems like a password, which after testing - works for the next level.
