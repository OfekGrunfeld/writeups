# Description
```
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

> NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to `ssh` into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

Searching up online where I can find the default shell for another user - it apparentaly appears in `/etc/passwd`:
```shell
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
```

`showtext` is a simple script that just executes:
```
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```
We can use the more binary to run commands as they are listed when `h` is pressed inside the program (manpage: `!command or !:command`).
Therefore going to edit the document with the `vi` keybind, we can execute the command `:set shell=/bin/bash` and then `:shell`:
```
:shell
bandit26@bandit:~$ 
```
success!
