# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
```
---
This cipher is called `rot13` (character position in the alphabet rotated by 13 where the ends warp around). Reading the hinted commands manpage, `tr` can be used to translate between our ciphertext and plaintext.

`tr manpage`:
```
...
       -c, -C, --complement
              use the complement of ARRAY1
...
       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order
...
```


```shell
# Trying this won't work because `tr` doesn't loop around
$ cat data.txt | tr -c "a-z" "n-m"; echo
tr: range-endpoints of 'n-m' are in reverse collating sequence order
# --->
$ cat data.txt | tr -c "a-z" "n-za-m"; echo
Ghe password is 7x16JAeUVi5LkVhJsfSVqoognHGyj9D4
# Also doesn't work as expected, we need support for upper-case characters
# --->
$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'; echo 
The password is FLAG{}
```

# Flag
