# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory
```
---
Should be easily avoidable with wrapping the filename in a string. (`" {FILENAME} "):
```shell
$ cat "--spaces in this filename--"
cat: unrecognized option '--spaces in this filename--'
Try 'cat --help' for more information.
```
Didn't work. Let's use the trick from the previous level with `./`:
```shell
$ cat "./--spaces in this filename--"
FLAG{} 
```
