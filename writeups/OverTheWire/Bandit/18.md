# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

Logging with ssh prints "Byebye!" and leaves. We just need to run the commands at ssh login with `ssh -x`:
```shell
sshpass -p "FLAG18{}" ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -x "cat readme"
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
