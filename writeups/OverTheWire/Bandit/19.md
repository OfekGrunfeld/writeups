# Description
```
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
```
---
Using the suid binary `bandit20-do`:
```shell
$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do whoami
```
Basically shell as `bandit20` user. Let's read the flag:
```
$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
FLAG{}
```
