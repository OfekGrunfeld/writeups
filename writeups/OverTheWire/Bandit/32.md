# Description
```
After all this `git` stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!

Logging in there is another is another string appended at the end of our login, and it seems like we are inside a shell program:
```
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> 
```
Everything I write here is switched to uppercase.
A quick research concluded that we can try to use env variables as they are uppercase.
Then looking the the env variables, `$0` just points to the default shell - which I though might be the UPPERCASE SHELL, but it was actually `sh`:
```shell
>> ls     
sh: 1: LS: Permission denied
>> $0
$ echo $0    
sh
$ /bin/bash
bandit33@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
FLAG{}
```


# Flag
