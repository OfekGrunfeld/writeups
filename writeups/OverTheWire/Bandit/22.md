# Description
```
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
```

`/etc/cron.d/` also has a cronjob for level 23: `cronjob_bandit23`:
```
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```
We can replicate it with replacing the `$myname` variable with bandit23 as the `whoami` is deterministically `bandit23`.
```shell
$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
