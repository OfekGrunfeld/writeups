# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Look at the commands that logged you into previous bandit levels, and find out how to use the key for this level.
```

I first tried to see if the private key is configured already:
```shell
ssh bandit14@localhost
```
But I found it in the home directory. To log on with that we need to copy from the remote:
```shell
sshpass -p "FLAG12{}" scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private ./
```
Then use it:
```shell
ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i sshkey.private 
```
We get an error for bad permission (readable to group), so we need to revoke them with `chmod`:
```
chmod g-r sshkey.private
```
Then ssh.


# Flag

No flag, SSH key: sshkey.private
