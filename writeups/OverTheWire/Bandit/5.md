# Description
```
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable
```
---
Reading the manpage for find I found there are exact flags for what we need:
```shell
$ find . -size 1033c \! -executable -readable                                    
./maybehere07/.file2
$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
FLAG{}
```

# Flag
