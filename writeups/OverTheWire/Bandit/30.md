# Description
```
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit30-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit30-git` is the same as for the user `bandit30`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
```
---
Same as last level. Found a `secret` tag with `git tag`. For some reason I couldn't checkout to it.
I couldn't find any info in the `.git` directory. It took some time with trial and error but I learned of the `git show` command - to get the commit of the tag and maybe jump to it that way. But running it, the commit seemed like the password - and that worked for level 31!
