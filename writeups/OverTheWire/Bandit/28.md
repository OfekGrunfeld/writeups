# Description
```
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit28-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit28-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit28-git` is the same as for the user `bandit28`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
```
---
Same as last level, this time the README is filled with junk.
Instead of trying to find a plaintext password in the `.git` folder, I tried to use `git` features - and `git log` rewarded me with:
```

We can visit the commit with:
```shell
git checkout HEAD^1
```
Then `cat` the `README`:
