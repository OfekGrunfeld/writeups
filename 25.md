## Directions
- New query parsing instead of `$_POST` and also differantiating from what's used in the include with `$GET`
```
parse_str(parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])['query'], $query);
```
- Apparently the `parse_url` function doesn't know how to handle `&:` (and then a number) in a query and drops it, but the engine behind `$_GET` does recognize it
	- `http://.../.../.../...?page=flag&:1:
  ... :(
